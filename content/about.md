My name is Zisis and i am a software engineer from Athens, Greece.
Iâ€™m passionate about launching awesome products and helping scale systems and teams.
I enjoy studying and experimenting with web technologies, distributed systems, databases and programming languages.

I really enjoy just building things. I release most of the stuff i make on [github](https://github.com/zisismaras).

In the past year i have taken great interest in 3d printing and CNC machines in general.  
I have been learning more about electronics, low level firmware programming and designing functional parts.  
I have also spent quite some time designing and building a custom [delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_robot)-like 3d printer which i am planning on open-sourcing soon.
